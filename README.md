Your Connection to the Blockchains RPC client, and the types of hardware associated with mining 


Most mining applications connect to the blockchains via RPC Client or REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL. most mining pools will have it readily available for all to view.


rpc examples


stratum+tcp://solo.btc.com:3333


stratum+tcp://stratum.pool.com:3333


but from the information i've gathered and also from very little mining activity done through United States stratum the ideal method would be to mine through the connection based on location. us miners:


stratum+tcp://us.ss.btc.com:3333


stratum+tcp://stratum-us.pool.com:3333


GETWORK
the connection is different form traditional internet protocol or IP. most blockchains connect via transmission control protocol or TCP hence the example: stratum+tcp.... as part of the JSON RPC proof of work.
