Your Connection to the Blockchains RPC client, and the types of hardware associated with mining 


Most mining applications connect to the blockchains via RPC Client or REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL. most mining pools will have it readily available for all to view.


rpc examples


stratum+tcp://solo.btc.com:3333


stratum+tcp://stratum.pool.com:3333


but from the information i've gathered and also from very little mining activity done through United States stratum the ideal method would be to mine through the connection based on location. us miners:


stratum+tcp://us.ss.btc.com:3333


stratum+tcp://stratum-us.pool.com:3333


GETWORK
the connection is different form traditional internet protocol or IP. most blockchains connect via transmission control protocol or TCP hence the example: stratum+tcp.... as part of the JSON RPC proof of work.


Hardware


Central Processing Units or CPU: in blockchains early days like bitcoin the blocks were solvable through the utilization of mining programs. but as the race for speed in solving the blocks grew this method has since become least ideal. as theyre has since been many big changes in the way mining is performed.


Graphics Processing Units or GPU: as the speed of solving blocks grew so did the block size. the average bitcoin block is 1 MB while in bitcoins case the crypto is not "Memory" heavy. it is Processor heavy. most crypto blockchains are memory heavy and this is the most popular method for mining "Altcoins" It has since become obsolete to mine Bitcoin this way. the power required for a powerful GPU mining unit is not worth the bitcoin payout as it generates tremendous heat and uses alot of energy.  


Application Specific Integrated Circuits or ASIC's: in order to get any kind of bitcoin with a reasonable amount of profit, you need to be processing hash algorithms in the TRILLIONS! or TH/s per 24 period. ASIC's are able to achieve this However. the smaller units processing 1-3 TH/s or The BIG GUN bitmains Antminer S9 at a whopping 14TH/s utilizing nearly 200 ASIC Processors! its important to note that currently only bitcoin and litecoin have ASIC's at this time.
